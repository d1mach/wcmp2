[big]*i.     Abstract*

Discovery and search is a key component to WIS 2.0.  Providing quality discovery metadata leveraging industry standards, best practices
and architecture helps lower the barrier to and extend the reach of weather, climte, and water information.

This document defines the encoding for the WMO Core Metadata Profile (WCMP).

WCMP documents provide descriptive information for discovery for WMO resources.  WMO resources include, but are not limited to, data (NWP
models, networks of observations, forecasts and warnings, etc.), services/APIs, and processes.

WCMP documents can be made avaiable as basic, HTTPS crawelable files, or via the WIS 2.0 catalogue (TODO: we need to define the WIS 2.0 catalogue).
